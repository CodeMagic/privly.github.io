<h2 id="what_is_privly">What is Privly</h2>

All too often you are forced to trade your personal privacy for access to the latest technologies. This "bargain" risks your personal data to changing rules, well meaning system changes, and criminal hacking.

Privly makes it impossible for others to control your personal data by hiding the content behind a user-controlled hyperlink. A Privly browser extension will then "inject" the content in place of the link without giving away access to the content. For those who don’t have the extension installed, they see a simple link. For those who do have the extension installed, they are able to see your post on the page as it was intended. That’s because the extension pulls the data from the other side of the link into your Facebook page, Twitter feed, etc, seamlessly, without supplying that data to data miners. Meaning your content stays, your content.

Privly Does:

- Give you the ability to share/post/tweet/chat anywhere without giving the host site access to the content
- Give you the power to grant or revoke access to your content to anyone or anywhere
- Give the content creator ownership of their data


Official Privly Hosts Do NOT:

- Use or sell your data
- Give your data to third party companies
- Own your content, you do


Privly has proven itself as a concept. You can use it right now with Facebook, Gmail, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, and just about anywhere else. As we refine the extensions and develop versions for other browsers, we hope you will check back. Sign up for an invitation, donate, or get a developer account and start building!

<h2>How does Privly work?</h2>

Privly gives you more than privacy, it gives you security. Shifting your data and trust from an organization that sells your data to one that in the long run, can’t even protect it, doesn’t help. Eventually, a hacker, rogue employee, government, or even someone close to you will expose everything you wrote in an email, said in a chat, or posted in a message. No one can be trusted to protect your data forever, so how can you use the internet for personal communication? The answer to the privacy problem is encryption.

Most users do not host their own web server, so Privly will enable people to trust any storage provider by taking away their ability to read your content. The Privly extensions will encrypt your data before you send it to a server for storage. Encrypting your data means the server only sees a scrambled version of your content. This way, you can store your data anywhere without losing your privacy.

Privly is built as an "Open Privacy Stack," meaning it is not tied to a particular way of doing things. Special "Privly Applications" will develop to meet your communication needs, and seamlessly interface with your favorite web communities. You don't have to sacrifice functionality to gain your privacy.

<h2>Organization</h2>

The Privly Foundation

Privacy on the internet is not something that can--or should--be owned. Privly's 2012 Kickstarter funded the creation of the Privly Foundation. Incorporating the technology into a (pending) 501(c)3 tax-exempt foundation ensures the mission focus of Privly will be maintained. We thank our many donors on the Privly donation page.

More information about the Privly Foundation can be found on www.privly.org. The inaugural Privly Foundation board meeting took place in September 2012 with the following board members:
