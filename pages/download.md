The extensions are under active development. Check back later if you do not like change and filing [bug reports](http://www.privly.org/content/bug-report). We will announce developments on Privly's [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/#!/Privly).

Please note that the extension does **not** currently offer:
- Protection from governments
- Protection from our hosting provider (currently US based Rackspace)
- Protection from the domain name system
- Or security of any kind
    
We made the extension available so you can test it out with your favorite site, but until we tell you otherwise, post with the expectation that it is public.

### Where is my browser?

We need to bring Privly to other browsers and platforms, so if you don't see your endpoint here, please consider [helping out](http://www.privly.org/content/how-get-started).

# Test Your Extension on These Pages

The following pages are pre-seeded with Privly content so you can test the extension out: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002254562518&sk=wall) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/PrivlyTest). You can also post the public links below to any website to see how it handles. Let us know if you have any [problems](http://www.privly.org/content/bug-report). It should work in any basic HTML form.
